Tearsheet supports the \`enable-presence\` feature flag. When enabled, Tearsheet will not mount until it's opened and unmount when it's closed. This helps to stay in sync with the React lifecycle.

This means that:

- The DOM no longer includes Tearsheet and its children in the closed state
- Tearsheet, all of its children and their hooks will mount/unmount on open/close
- Enter & exit animations change from CSS transitions to CSS animations

Note: Only Tearsheet and its children are unmounted/mounted. Use TearsheetPresence or withTearsheetPresence to shift the presence boundary to a higher level, if necessary.
